# Doubly Linked List Project

This project contains a C# implementation of a Doubly Linked List, along with a demonstration of its usage to read and process a file. 

## DoublyLinkedListProject

The `DoublyLinkedList` class is a generic doubly linked list implementation. It provides methods for inserting, removing, and sorting elements in the list. This class is designed to work with characters and keep track of their frequencies.

## FileDemo

The `FileDemo` class is an example of how to use the `DoublyLinkedList` class to read a text file, count the frequency of characters, and sort them in two ways: by character name and by frequency.

## EmptyListException

The `EmptyListException` class is a custom exception used in the `DoublyLinkedList` class to handle cases where operations are performed on an empty list.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Include the provided classes in your C# project.
2. Initialize a `DoublyLinkedList` instance and use it to process a text file.
3. Use the `SortByCharName` and `SortByCharFrequency` methods to sort the list in two different ways.
